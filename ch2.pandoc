**Sentential logic**
====================

This chapter introduces a logical language called SL. It is a version of
*sentential logic*, because the basic units of the language will
represent entire sentences. (Recall from
§1.2 that we're only considering propositional
sentences.)

**2.1 Sentence letters**
----------------

In SL, capital Roman letters (*A*, *B*, *C*, etc.) are used to represent
basic sentences. Considered only as a symbol of SL, the letter $A$ could
mean any sentence. So when translating from English into SL, it is
important to provide a *symbolization key*. The key provides an English
language sentence for each sentence letter used in the symbolization.

For example, consider this argument:

> | 1. <span class="premise">Today is New Year's Day.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">If today is New Year's Day, then people are swimming in English Bay.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">People are swimming in English Bay.</span>

This is obviously a valid argument in English. In symbolizing it, we
want to preserve the structure of the argument that makes it valid. What
happens if we replace each sentence with a letter? Our symbolization key
would look like this:

<blockquote>
**A:** Today is New Year's Day. <br/>
**B:** If today is New Year's Day, then people are swimming in English Bay. <br/>
**C:** People are swimming in English Bay.
</blockquote>

We could then symbolize the argument in this way:

> | 1. <span class="premise">*A*</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">*B*</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">*C*</span>

This is a possible way to symbolize this argument, but it's not a very
interesting one. There is no necessary connection between some sentence
$A$, which could be any sentence, and some other sentences $B$ and $C$,
which could be any sentences. Something important about the argument has
been lost in translation. The original argument was valid, but this
translation of the argument does not reflect that validity. Given a
different symbolization key, for example, the same argument form

> | 1. <span class="premise">*A*</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">*B*</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">*C*</span>

could equally well stand in for this invalid argument:

> | 1. <span class="premise">Today is Christmas Day.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">Tiny Tim has difficulty walking without crutches.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">We're all going to die tomorrow.</span>

A more interesting translation of the valid New Year's argument will
show how it is different from the invalid Christmas argument. The
relevant thing about the New Year's argument is that the second premise
is not just *any* sentence. Notice that the second premise contains the
first premise and the conclusion *as parts*. Our symbolization key for
the argument only needs to include meanings for $A$ and $C$, and we can
build the second premise from those pieces. So we symbolize the argument
this way:

> | 1. <span class="premise">*A*</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">If *A*, then *C*.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">*C*</span>

This preserves the structure of the argument that makes it valid, but it
still makes use of the English expression 'If$\ldots$ then$\ldots$.'
Although for our formal language we ultimately want to replace all of
the English expressions with logical notation, this is a good start.

The sentences that can be symbolized with sentence letters are called
*atomic sentences*, because they are the basic building blocks out of
which more complex sentences can be built. Whatever logical structure a
sentence might have is lost when it is translated as an atomic sentence.
From the point of view of SL, the sentence is just a letter. It can be
used to build more complex sentences, but it cannot be taken apart.

We use capital Roman alphabet letters to represent SL sentences. There
are only twenty-six such letters. We don't want to impose this
artificial limit onto our formal language; it's better to work with a
language that allows an arbitrary number of atomic sentences. To achieve
this, we allow atomic sentences that have a capital letter with a
numerical subscript. So we could have a symbolization key that looks
like this:

<blockquote>
**A<sub>1</sub>:** Aang is from the Air Nation. <br/>
**A<sub>2</sub>:** Aang is vegetarian. <br/>
**A<sub>3</sub>:** Aang can bend water. <br/>
**T<sub>1</sub>:** Toph is blind. <br/>
**T<sub>2</sub>:** Toph likes badgers. <br/>
**T<sub>3</sub>:** Toph invented metal bending.
</blockquote>

Keep in mind that each of these is a different atomic sentence. Although
it is often convenient, for making it easier to remember what each
letter stands for, to use letters corresponding to the sentences'
subject matters, as in the example above, no such requirement is built
into the rules of SL. There is no special relationship between *A*<sub>1</sub>
and *A*<sub>2</sub>, as far as SL goes. It's just for our convenience that we
might choose to make all the *A* sentences about Aang.

**2.2 Connectives**
-------------------

Logical connectives are used to build complex sentences from atomic
components. There are five logical connectives in SL. This table
summarizes them. They are explained below.

<table>
  <tr><th>symbol</th><th>what it is called</th><th>rough translation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>[negation]</td><td>negation</td><td>'It is not the case that...'</td></tr>
  <tr><td>[conjunction]</td><td>conjunction</td><td>'Both... and ...'</td></tr>
  <tr><td>[disjunction]</td><td>disjunction</td><td>'Either... or ...'</td></tr>
  <tr><td>[conditional]</td><td>conditional</td><td>'If ... then ...'</td></tr>
  <tr><td>[biconditional]</td><td>biconditional</td><td>'... if and only if ...'</td></tr>
</table>

Natural languages like English are vague and imprecise, and carry many
complex subtleties of meaning. Our formal language, SL, has none of
these properties. It is defined by precise rigid rules. Consequently,
the 'translation' provided in the table is only an approximate one.
We'll see some of the differences below.

**2.3 Negation**
----------------

Consider how we might symbolize these sentences:

> | 1. <span class="premise">Logic is hard.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">It is false that logic is hard.</span>
> | 3. <span class="premise">Logic isn't hard.</span>

In order to symbolize sentence 1, we will need one sentence letter. We can provide a
symbolization key:

> **H:** Logic is hard

Now, sentence 1 is simply *H*.

Since sentence 2 is obviously related to sentence 1,
we do not want to introduce a different sentence
letter. To put it partly in English, the sentence means 'It is false
that *H*.' In order to symbolize this, we need a symbol for logical
negation. We will use '[not]' Now we can translate 'Not *H*' to [not]*H*.
In general, '[not]' means 'it is false that'.

What of Sentence 3? It looks like a more natural way of saying the same
thing as sentence 2. It's saying that logic isn't hard, which is just
another way of denying that logic is hard. So sentences 2 and 3 have the same
truth conditions. In the terminology of
Ch. 1[link to ch1], they are logically equivalent. So we can
translate both sentence 2 and sentence 3 as [not]*H*.

When translating from English into SL, the word 'not' is usually a
pretty good clue that '[not]' will be an appropriate symbol to use, but it's
important to think about the actual meaning of the sentence, and not
rely too much on which words appear in it.

(For more on the '[not]' notation, see the 'note about notation' on [find reference])

Consider these further examples:

> | 4. <span class="premise">Rodrigo is mortal.</span>
> | 5. <span class="premise">Rodrigo is immortal.</span>
> | 6. <span class="premise">Rodrigo is not immortal.</span>

If we let *R* mean 'Rodrigo is mortal', then sentence 4 can be
translated as *R*.

What about sentence 5? Being immortal is pretty much the same as not being
mortal. So it makes sense to treat 5 as the negation
of 4, symbolizing it as [not]*R*.

Sentence 6 can be paraphrased as 'It is not the case that Rodrigo is immortal.'
Using negation twice, we translate this as [not][not]*R*. The two negations
in a row each work as negations, so the sentence means 'It is not the
case that... it is not the case that... *R*.' It is the
negation of the negation of *R*. One can negate *any* sentence of SL by
putting the [not] symbol in front of it. It's not only for atomic sentences.

Here is an example that illustrates some of the complexities of
translation.

> | 7. <span class="premise">Elliott is happy.</span>
> | 8. <span class="premise">Elliott is unhappy.</span>

If we let *H* mean 'Elliot is happy', then we can symbolize sentence 7 as *H*.

We might be tempted to symbolize sentence 8 as [not]*H*.
But is being unhappy the same thing as not being happy? This is perhaps
debatable. One might think that it is possible to be neither happy nor
unhappy. Maybe Elliot is in this in-between zone. If so, then we
shouldn't treat 8 as the negation of 7. If we're allowing that 'unhappy' means something
different from 'not happy', then we will need to use a different atomic sentence to translate 8.

What of the *truth conditions* for negated sentences?

For any sentence [phi]: If [phi] is true, then [not][phi] is false. If [phi] is false, then [not][phi] is true.
Using '1' for true and '0' for false, we can summarize this in a
*characteristic truth table* for negation:

<table>
<tr><th>[phi]</th><th>[not][phi]</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

The left column shows the possible truth values for a given sentence;
the right column shows the truth value of the negation of that sentence.

We will discuss truth tables at greater length in Chapter 3.

**2.4 Conjunction**
-------------------

Consider these sentences:

> | 9. <span class="premise">Jessica is strong.</span>
> | 10. <span class="premise">Luke is strong.</span>
> | 11. <span class="premise">Jessica is strong, and Luke is also strong.</span>

We will need separate sentence letters for 9 and
10, so we define
this symbolization key:

> **J:** Jessica is strong. <br/>
> **L:** Luke is strong.

Sentence 9 can be symbolized as *J*.

Sentence 10 can be symbolized as *L*.

Sentence 11 can be paraphrased as '*J* and *L*.' In order to fully symbolize this sentence,
we need another symbol. We will use '[and]' We translate '*J* and *L*' as (*J*[and]*L*). The logical connective '[and]' is called **conjunction**, and *J* and *L* are
each called **conjuncts**.

Notice that we make no attempt to symbolize 'also' in sentence 11. Words like 'both' and 'also' function to draw our attention to the fact that two
things are being conjoined. They are not doing any further logical work,
so we do not need to represent them in SL. Note that Sentence 11 would have meant the same thing had it simply said 'Jessica is strong, and Luke is strong.'

Here are some more examples:

> | 12. <span class="premise">Jessica is strong and grumpy.</span>
> | 13. <span class="premise">Jessica and Matt are both strong.</span>
> | 14. <span class="premise">Although Luke is strong, he is not grumpy.</span>
> | 15. <span class="premise">Matt is strong, but Jessica is stronger than Matt.</span>

Sentence 12 is
obviously a conjunction. The sentence says two things about Jessica, so
in English it is permissible to use her name only once. It might be
tempting to try this when translating the argument: Since *J* means
'Jessica is strong', one might attempt to paraphrase sentence 12 as '*J* and
grumpy.' But this would be a mistake. Once we translate part of a
sentence as *J*, any further structure within the original sentence is
lost. *J* is an atomic sentence; SL doesn't keep track of the fact that
it was intended to be about Jessica. Moreover, 'grumpy' is not a
sentence; on its own it is neither true nor false. So instead, we
paraphrase sentence 12 as '*J* and Jessica is grumpy.' Now we need to add a
sentence letter to the symbolization key. Let *G*<sub>1</sub> mean 'Jessica is
grumpy.' Now the sentence can be translated as *J*[and]*G*<sub>1</sub>.

Sentence 13 says
one thing about two different subjects. It says of both Jessica and Matt
that they are strong, and in English we use the word 'strong' only once.
In translating to SL, we want to make sure each conjunct is a sentence
on its own, so once again, we'll paraphrase it by repeating the
elements: 'Jessica is strong, and Matt is strong.' Once we add a new
atomic sentence *M* for 'Matt is strong', this translates as *J*[and]*M*.

Sentence 14 is a
bit more complicated. The word 'although' tends to suggest a kind of
contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part.
Nevertheless, the sentence is still telling us two things: Luke is
strong, and he's not grumpy. So we can paraphrase sentence 14 as, '*Both*
Luke is strong, *and* Luke is not grumpy.' The second conjunct contains
a negation, so we paraphrase further: '*Both* Luke is strong *and* *it
is not the case that* Luke is grumpy.' Let's let *G*<sub>2</sub> stand for 'Luke
is grumpy', and we can translate sentence
14 as *L*[and][not]*G*<sub>2</sub>.

Once again, this is an imperfect translation of the English sentence 14.
That sentence implicated that there was a contrast between Luke's two properties.
Our translation merely says that he has both of them. Still, it is a
translation that preserves some of the important features of the
original. In particular, it says that Luke is strong, and it also says
that he's not grumpy.

Sentence 15's use
of the word 'but' indicates a similar contrastive structure. It is
irrelevant for the purpose of translating to SL, so we can paraphrase
the sentence as '*Both* Matt is strong, *and* Jessica is stronger than
Matt.' How should we translate the second conjunct? We already have the
sentence letters *J* and *M*, which each say that one of Jessica and
Matt is strong, but neither of these says anything comparative. We need
a new sentence letter. Let *S* mean 'Jessica is stronger than Matt.' Now
the sentence translates as (*M*[and]*S*).

[insert from pdf not in conversion]

It is important to keep in mind that the sentence letters *J*, *M*,
*G*<sub>1</sub>, *G*<sub>2</sub>, and *S* are atomic sentences. Considered as symbols of
SL, they have no meaning beyond being true or false. We used *J* and *M*
to symbolize different English language sentences that are about people
being strong, but this similarity is completely lost when we translate
to SL. Nor does SL recognize any particular similarity between *G*<sub>1</sub>
and *G*<sub>2</sub>.

For any sentences [phi] and [psi], ([phi][and][psi]) is true if and only if both [phi] and [psi] are true. We
can summarize this in the characteristic truth table for conjunction:

<table>
<tr><th>[phi]</th><th>[psi]</th><th>[phi][and][psi]</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

The two left columns indicate the truth values of the two conjuncts.
Since there are four possible combinations of truth values, there are
four rows. The conjunction is true when both conjuncts are true, and
false in all other cases.

### **2.4.1 A Note About Notation**

In speaking generally about connectives, we've used the '[phi]' and '[psi]'
symbols as variables to stand in for sentences of SL. We saw, for
instance, that for any sentence [phi],[not][phi] is the negation of [phi]. This means:

-   [not]*A* is the negation of *A*

-   [not]*B*<sub>1</sub>is the negation of *B*<sub>1</sub>

-   [not]*B*<sub>1</sub> is the negation of *B*<sub>2</sub>

-   [not][not]*C* is the negation of [not]*C*

-   [not](*A* [and] *B*) is the negation of (*A* [and] *B*)

-   etc.

Note that [phi] and [psi] are *not* sentences of SL. They are symbols we use to talk
about SL sentences, but they're not themselves part of our formal
language. (Compare the use of variables like *x* in algebra. An '*x*'
symbol is used to stand in for any number, but *x* is not itself a
number.) We'll return to this distinction in
§2.9, and again later on when we discuss
proving generalities about SL.

**2.5 Disjunction**
-------------------

Consider these sentences:

> | 16. <span class="premise">Denison will golf with me or he will watch movies.</span>
> | 17. <span class="premise">Either Denison or Ellery will golf with me.</span>

For these sentences we can use this symbolization key:

<blockquote>
**D:** Denison will golf with me. <br/>
**E:**Ellery will golf with me. <br/>
**M:**Denison will watch movies.
</blockquote>

Sentence 16 is
'Either *D* or *M*.' To fully symbolize this, we introduce a new symbol.
The sentence becomes (*D* [or] *M*)$. The '[or]' connective is called **disjunction**, and *D*
and *M* are called **disjuncts**.

Sentence 17 is only
slightly more complicated. There are two subjects, but the English
sentence only gives the verb once. In translating, we can paraphrase it
as 'Either Denison will play golf with me, or Ellery will play golf with
me.' Now it obviously translates as (*D* [or] *E*).

[insert portion from pdf]

What truth conditions should we offer for '[or]' sentences? If I say,
'Denison will golf with me or he will watch movies', under what
circumstances will that sentence be true? When will it be false? Well,
suppose he doesn't do either activity. Suppose he goes swimming, and
doesn't watch movies, and doesn't golf with me. Then my sentence is
false.

Suppose Denison skips the movies and golfs with me instead. Then it
seems pretty clear that my disjunctive claim was true. Likewise if he
goes to the movies and leaves me without a golf partner. It's a little
less clear what to think about the English sentence if *both* disjuncts
end up true. Suppose that Denison comes golfing with me, *and also*
stays up late afterward to come with me to the movies. Then is it true
that 'he golfed with me or went to the movies'? This is not entirely
clear. Certainly it would be strange to assert such a sentence if you
know that both elements were true. On the other hand, it doesn't exactly
seem *false* that he'll golf with me or watch movies, if in fact he'll
do both. In a study of the semantics of English, it would be appropriate
to pursue this question much further. In this introduction to formal
logic, we'll simply stipulate the features of our formal symbol. '[or]'
stands for an *inclusive or*, which means it is true if and only if *at
least one disjunct* is true.

So (*D* [or] *E*) is true if *D* is true, if *D* is true, or if both *D*
and *E* are true. It is false only if both *D* and *E* are false. We can
summarize this with the characteristic truth table for disjunction:

<table>
<tr><th>[phi]</th><th>[psi]</th><th>[phi][or][psi]</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

Note that both conjunction and disjunction are symmetrical. ([phi] [and] [psi]) is
logically equivalent to ([psi] [and] [phi]), and ([phi] [or] [psi]) is logically equivalent to ([psi] [or] [phi]).

These sentences are somewhat more complicated:

> | 18. <span class="premise">Either you will not have soup, or you will not have salad.</span>
> | 19. <span class="premise">You will have neither soup nor salad.</span>
> | 20. <span class="premise">You get soup or salad, but not both.</span>

Here's a symbolization key:

> **S**<sub>1</sub>You will get soup. <br/>
> **S**<sub>2</sub>You will get salad.

Sentence 18 can be
paraphrased in this way: 'Either *it is not the case that* you get soup,
or *it is not the case that* you get salad.' Translating this requires
both disjunction and negation. It becomes ([not] *S*<sub>1</sub> [or] [not] *S*<sub>2</sub>).

Sentence 19 also
requires negation. It can be paraphrased as, '*It is not the case that*
either that you get soup or that you get salad.' We need some way of
indicating that the negation does not just negate the right or left
disjunct, but rather negates the entire disjunction. In order to do
this, we put parentheses around the disjunction: 'It is not the case
that (*S*<sub>1</sub> [or] *S*<sub>2</sub>).' This becomes simply $\enot (S_1 \eor S_2)$. (A
second, equivalent, way to translate this sentence is
$(\enot S_1 \eand \enot S_2)$. We'll see why this is equivalent later
on.)

Notice that the parentheses are doing important work here. The sentence
$(\enot S_1 \eor S_2)$ would mean 'Either you will not have soup, or you
will have salad,' which is very different.

Sentence [\[or5\]](#or5){reference-type="ref" reference="or5"} has a
more complex structure. We can break it into two parts. The first part
says that you get one or the other. We translate this as
$(S_1 \eor S_2)$. The second part says that you do not get both. We can
paraphrase this as, 'It is not the case both that you get soup and that
you get salad.' Using both negation and conjunction, we translate this
as $\enot(S_1 \eand S_2)$. Now we just need to put the two parts
together. As we saw above, 'but' can usually be translated as a
conjunction. Sentence [\[or5\]](#or5){reference-type="ref"
reference="or5"} can thus be translated as
$((S_1 \eor S_2) \eand \enot(S_1 \eand S_2))$.

Conditional
-----------

For the following sentences, use this symbolization key:

You will cut the red wire.

The bomb will explode.

If you cut the red wire, then the bomb will explode.

The bomb will explode only if you cut the red wire.

Sentence [\[if1\]](#if1){reference-type="ref" reference="if1"} can be
translated partially as 'If $R$, then $B$.' We will use the symbol '' to
represent this conditional relationship. The sentence becomes
$(R\eif B)$. The connective is called a . The sentence on the left-hand
side of the conditional ($R$ in this example) is called the . The
sentence on the right-hand side ($B$) is called the .

Sentence [\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} is also a
conditional. Since the word 'if' appears in the second half of the
sentence, it might be tempting to symbolize this in the same way as
sentence [\[if1\]](#if1){reference-type="ref" reference="if1"}. That
would be a mistake.

The conditional $(R\eif B)$ says that *if* $R$ were true, *then* $B$
would also be true. It does not say that your cutting the red wire is
the *only* way that the bomb could explode. Someone else might cut the
wire, or the bomb might be on a timer. The sentence $(R\eif B)$ does not
say anything about what to expect if $R$ is false. Sentence
[\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} is different. It
says that the only conditions under which the bomb will explode are ones
where you cut the red wire; i.e., if the bomb explodes, then you must
have cut the wire. As such, sentence
[\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} should be
symbolized as $(B \eif R)$.

It is important to remember that the connective '' says only that, if
the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true. It says nothing
about the *causal* connection between the two events. Translating
sentence [\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} as
$(B \eif R)$ does not mean that the bomb exploding would somehow have
caused your cutting the wire. Both sentence
[\[if1\]](#if1){reference-type="ref" reference="if1"} and
[\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} suggest that, if
you cut the red wire, your cutting the red wire would be the cause of
the bomb exploding. They differ on the *logical* connection. If sentence
[\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} were true, then an
explosion would tell us --- those of us safely away from the bomb ---
that you had cut the red wire. Without an explosion, sentence
[\[if2\]](#if2){reference-type="ref" reference="if2"} tells us nothing.

'If then ' means that if is true then so is . So we know that if the
antecedent is true but the consequent is false, then the conditional 'If
then ' is false. What is the truth value of 'If then ' under other
circumstances? Suppose, for instance, that the antecedent happened to be
false. 'If then ' would then not tell us anything about the actual truth
value of the consequent , and it is unclear what the truth value of 'If
then ' would be.

In English, the truth of conditionals often depends on what *would* be
the case if the antecedent *were true* --- even if, as a matter of fact,
the antecedent is false. This poses a serious challenge for translating
conditionals into SL. Considered as sentences of SL, $R$ and $B$ in the
above examples have nothing intrinsic to do with each other. In order to
consider what the world would be like if $R$ were true, we would need to
analyze what $R$ says about the world. Since $R$ is an atomic symbol of
SL, however, there is no further structure to be analyzed. When we
replace a sentence with a sentence letter, we consider it merely as some
atomic sentence that might be true or false.

In order to translate conditionals into SL, we will not try to capture
all the subtleties of English's 'if$\ldots$ then$\ldots$.' construction.
Instead, the symbol '' will signify a *material conditional*. This means
that when is false, the conditional () is automatically true, regardless
of the truth value of . If both and are true, then the conditional () is
true.

In short, () is false if and only if is true and is false. We can
summarize this with a characteristic truth table for the conditional.

  --- --- ---
   1   1   1
   1   0   0
   0   1   1
   0   0   1
  --- --- ---

More than any other connective, the SL translation of the conditional is
a rough approximation. It has some very counterintuitive consequences
about the truth-values of conditionals. You can see from the truth
table, for example, that an SL conditional is true any time the
consequent is true, no matter what the antecedent is. (Look at lines 1
and 3 in the chart.) And it is also true any time the antecedent is
false, no matter what the consequent is. (Look at lines 3 and 4.) This
is an odd consequence. In English, some conditionals with true
consequents and/or false antecedents seem clearly to be false. For
example:

If there are no philosophy courses at UBC, then PHIL 220 is a philosophy
course at UBC.

If this book has fewer than thirty pages, then it will win the 2018
Pulitzer prize for poetry.

Both [\[pmc1\]](#pmc1){reference-type="ref" reference="pmc1"} and
[\[pmc2\]](#pmc2){reference-type="ref" reference="pmc2"} seem clearly
false. But each of them, translated into SL, would come out true. (If
this isn't obvious, it's worth taking a moment to translate them and
consider the truth table.) I told you before that English translations
into SL are only approximate! Despite these odd results, the approach to
conditionals offered here actually preserves many of the most important
logical features of conditionals. We'll see this in more detail once we
start working with proofs. For now, I'll just ask you to go along with
this approach to conditionals, even though it will seem strange.

Note that unlike conjunction and disjunction, the conditional is
*asymmetrical*. You cannot swap the antecedent and consequent without
changing the meaning of the sentence, because () and () are not
logically equivalent.

Biconditional
-------------

Consider these sentences:

The figure on the board is a triangle only if it has exactly three
sides.

The figure on the board is a triangle if it has exactly three sides.

The figure on the board is a triangle if and only if it has exactly
three sides.

The figure is a triangle.

The figure has three sides.

Sentence [\[iff1\]](#iff1){reference-type="ref" reference="iff1"}, for
reasons discussed above, can be translated as $(T\eif S)$.

Sentence [\[iff2\]](#iff2){reference-type="ref" reference="iff2"} is
importantly different. It can be paraphrased as, 'If the figure has
three sides, then it is a triangle.' So it can be translated as
$(S\eif T$).

Sentence [\[iff3\]](#iff3){reference-type="ref" reference="iff3"} says
that $T$ is true *if and only if* $S$ is true; we can infer $S$ from
$T$, and we can infer $T$ from $S$. This is called a , because it
entails the two conditionals $S\eif T$ and $T \eif S$. We will use '' to
represent the biconditional; sentence
[\[iff3\]](#iff3){reference-type="ref" reference="iff3"} can be
translated as $(S \eiff T)$.

We could abide without a new symbol for the biconditional. Since
sentence [\[iff3\]](#iff3){reference-type="ref" reference="iff3"} means
'$(T \eif S)$ and $(S\eif T)$,' we could translate it as a conjunction
of those two conditionals --- as $((T \eif S)\eand(S\eif T))$. Notice
how the parentheses work: we need to add a new set of parentheses for
the conjunction, in addition to the ones that were already there for the
conditionals.

Because we could always write
$((\metaA{}\eif\metaB{})\eand(\metaB{}\eif\metaA{}))$ instead of
$(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$, we do not strictly speaking *need* to
introduce a new symbol for the biconditional. Nevertheless, logical
languages usually have such a symbol. SL will have one, which makes it
easier to translate phrases like 'if and only if.'

$(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$ is true if and only if and have the same truth
value: they're either both true, or they're both false. This is the
characteristic truth table for the biconditional:

  --- --- ---
   1   1   1
   1   0   0
   0   1   0
   0   0   1
  --- --- ---

Other symbolization
-------------------

We have now introduced all of the connectives of SL. We can use them
together to translate many kinds of sentences. Consider these examples
of sentences that use the English-language connective 'unless', with an
associated symbolization key:

Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold.

You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket.

You will wear a jacket.

You will catch a cold.

We can paraphrase sentence [\[unless1\]](#unless1){reference-type="ref"
reference="unless1"} as 'Unless $J$, $D$.' This means that if you do not
wear a jacket, then you will catch a cold; with this in mind, we might
translate it as $\enot J \eif D$. It also means that if you do not catch
a cold, then you must have worn a jacket; with this in mind, we might
translate it as $\enot D \eif J$.

Which of these is the correct translation of sentence
[\[unless1\]](#unless1){reference-type="ref" reference="unless1"}? Both
translations are correct, because the two translations are logically
equivalent in SL.

Sentence [\[unless2\]](#unless2){reference-type="ref"
reference="unless2"}, in English, is logically equivalent to sentence
[\[unless1\]](#unless1){reference-type="ref" reference="unless1"}. It
can be translated as either $\enot J \eif D$ or $\enot D \eif J$.

When symbolizing sentences like sentence
[\[unless1\]](#unless1){reference-type="ref" reference="unless1"} and
sentence [\[unless2\]](#unless2){reference-type="ref"
reference="unless2"}, it is easy to get turned around. Since the
conditional is not symmetric, it would be wrong to translate either
sentence as $J \eif \enot D$. Fortunately, there are other logically
equivalent expressions. Both sentences mean that you will wear a jacket
or --- if you do not wear a jacket --- then you will catch a cold. So we
can translate them as $J \eor D$.

Symbolization of standard sentence types is summarized on p. .

Sentences of SL {#sec:sentencesofSL}
---------------

The sentence 'Apples are red, or berries are blue' is a sentence of
English, and the sentence '$(A\eor B)$' is a sentence of SL. Although we
can identify sentences of English when we encounter them, we do not have
a formal definition of 'sentence of English'. In SL, it is possible to
formally define what counts as a sentence. This is one respect in which
a formal language like SL is more precise than a natural language like
English.

It is important to distinguish between the logical language SL, which we
are developing, and the language that we use to talk about SL. When we
talk about a language, the language that we are talking about is called
the . The language that we use to talk about the object language is
called the . [\[def.metalanguage\]]{#def.metalanguage
label="def.metalanguage"}

The object language in this chapter is SL. The metalanguage is English
--- not conversational English, but English supplemented with some
logical and mathematical vocabulary (including the '' and '' symbols).
The sentence '$(A\eor B)$' is a sentence in the object language, because
it uses only symbols of SL. The word 'sentence' is not itself part of
SL, however, so the sentence 'This expression is a sentence of SL' is
not a sentence of SL. It is a sentence in the metalanguage, a sentence
that we use to talk *about* SL.

In this section, we will give a formal definition for 'sentence of SL.'
The definition itself will be given in mathematical English, the
metalanguage.

### Expressions

There are three kinds of symbols in SL:

  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
        sentence letters                    $A,B,C,\ldots,Z$
   with subscripts, as needed   $A_1, B_1,Z_1,A_2,A_{25},J_{375},\ldots$
          connectives                             ,,,,
          parentheses                            ( , )
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------

We define an as any string of symbols of SL. Take any of the symbols of
SL and write them down, in any order, and you have an expression.

### Well-formed formulae

Since any sequence of symbols is an expression, many expressions of SL
will be gobbledegook. For example, these expressions don't mean
anything:

))

$A_4$

None of these are sentences in SL. A meaningful expression is called a .
It is common to use the acronym *wff*; the plural is wffs.

Individual sentence letters like $A$ and $G_{13}$ are certainly wffs. We
can form further wffs out of these by using the various connectives.
Using negation, we can get $\enot A$ and $\enot G_{13}$. Using
conjunction, we can get $(A \eand G_{13})$, $(G_{13} \eand A)$,
$(A \eand A)$, and $(G_{13} \eand G_{13})$. We could also apply negation
repeatedly to get wffs like $\enot \enot A$ or apply negation along with
conjunction to get wffs like $\enot(A \eand G_{13})$ and
$\enot(G_{13} \eand \enot G_{13})$. The possible combinations are
endless, even starting with just these two sentence letters, and there
are infinitely many sentence letters. So there is no point in trying to
list all the wffs.

Instead, we will describe the rules that govern how wffs can be
constructed. Consider negation: Given any wff of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is
a wff of SL. Remember, is not itself a sentence letter; it is a variable
that stands in for any wff at all (atomic or not). Since the variable is
not a symbol of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is not an expression of SL. Instead,
it is an expression of the metalanguage that allows us to talk about
infinitely many expressions of SL: all of the expressions that start
with the negation symbol. Because is part of the metalanguage, it is
called a *metavariable*.

Another way of saying that given any wff of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is a wff
of SL is to say that any time you have a wff of SL, you can make a new
wff by adding a '' symbol to the front of it.

We can say similar things for each of the other connectives. For
instance, if and are wffs of SL, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})$ is a wff
of SL. (That is to say, given any two wffs in SL, you can put a ''
symbol between them, a '(' in front of the first, and a ')' after the
second, and the whole thing will add up to a new wff.) Providing clauses
like this for all of the connectives, we arrive at the following formal
definition for a well-formed formula of SL:

1.  Every atomic sentence is a wff.

2.  For all expressions and ,

    1.  If is a wff, then $\enot\metaA{}$ is a wff.

    2.  If and are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})$ is a wff.

    3.  If and are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eor\metaB{})$ is a wff.

    4.  If and are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eif\metaB{})$ is a wff.

    5.  If and are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$ is a wff.

3.  Nothing else is a wff.

This is a *recursive* definition of a wff, illustrating how one can,
starting with the simplest cases (atomic sentences), build up more
complicated sentences of SL. If you have a wff, you can stick a '' in
front of it to make a new wff. If you have two wffs, you can put a '('
in front of the first one, followed by a '', followed by the second one,
then finally a ')', and end up with a new wff. Etc.

Note that these are purely *syntactic* rules. They tell you how to
construct an admissible ('grammatical') sentence in SL. They do not tell
you what the sentence will *mean*. (We've touched on that already, in
introducing characteristic truth tables. We'll return to this topic in
much more detail in Ch.
[\[ch.TruthTables\]](#ch.TruthTables){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.TruthTables"}.)

Suppose we want to know whether or not $\enot \enot \enot D$ is a wff of
SL. Looking at the second clause of the definition, we know that
$\enot \enot \enot D$ is a wff *if* $\enot \enot D$ is a wff. So now we
need to ask whether or not $\enot \enot D$ is a wff. Again looking at
the second clause of the definition, $\enot \enot D$ is a wff *if*
$\enot D$ is. Again, $\enot D$ is a wff *if* $D$ is a wff. Now $D$ is a
sentence letter, an atomic sentence of SL, so we know that $D$ is a wff
by the first clause of the definition. So for a compound formula like
$\enot \enot \enot D$, we must apply the definition repeatedly.
Eventually we arrive at the atomic sentences from which the wff is built
up.

The connective that you look to first in decomposing a sentence is
called the (or *main logical operator*) of that sentence. For example:
The main connective of $\enot (E \eor (F \eif G))$ is negation, . The
main connective of $(\enot E \eor (F \eif G))$ is disjunction, .
Conversely, if you're building up a wff from simpler sentences, the
connective introduced by the last rule you apply is the main connective.
It is the connective that governs the interpretation of the entire
sentence.

### Sentences

Recall that a sentence is a meaningful expression that can be true or
false. Since the meaningful expressions of SL are the wffs and since
every wff of SL is either true or false, the definition for a sentence
of SL is the same as the definition for a wff. Not every formal language
will have this nice feature. In the language QL, which is developed
later in the book, there are wffs which are not sentences.

The recursive structure of sentences in SL will be important when we
consider the circumstances under which a particular sentence would be
true or false. The sentence $\enot \enot \enot D$ is true if and only if
the sentence $\enot \enot D$ is false, and so on through the structure
of the sentence until we arrive at the atomic components:
$\enot \enot \enot D$ is true if and only if the atomic sentence $D$ is
false. We will return to this point in much more detail in Chapters
[\[ch.TruthTables\]](#ch.TruthTables){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.TruthTables"} and
[\[ch.SLmodels\]](#ch.SLmodels){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.SLmodels"}.

### Notational conventions {#SLconventions}

A wff like $(Q \eand R)$ must be surrounded by parentheses, because we
might apply the definition again to use this as part of a more
complicated sentence. If we negate $(Q \eand R)$, we get
$\enot(Q \eand R)$. If we just had $Q \eand R$ without the parentheses
and put a negation in front of it, we would have $\enot Q \eand R$. It
is most natural to read this as meaning the same thing as
$(\enot Q \eand R)$, something very different than $\enot(Q\eand R)$.
The sentence $\enot(Q \eand R)$ means that it is not the case that both
$Q$ and $R$ are true; $Q$ might be false or $R$ might be false, but the
sentence does not tell us which. The sentence $(\enot Q \eand R)$ means
specifically that $Q$ is false and that $R$ is true. So parentheses are
crucial to the meaning of the sentence.

Consequently, strictly speaking, $Q \eand R$ without parentheses is
*not* a sentence of SL. When using SL, however, we will sometimes be
able to relax the precise definition so as to make things easier for
ourselves. We will do this in several ways.

First, we understand that $Q \eand R$ means the same thing as
$(Q \eand R)$. As a matter of convention, we can leave off parentheses
that occur *around the entire sentence*. Think of this as a kind of
shorthand; we don't always write out the parentheses that we know are
really there.

Second, it can sometimes be confusing to look at long sentences with
nested sets of parentheses. We adopt the convention of using square
brackets '\[' and '\]' in place of parenthesis. There is no logical
difference between $(P\eor Q)$ and $[P\eor Q]$, for example. The
unwieldy sentence $$(((H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)) \eand (J \eor K))$$
could be written in this way, omitting the outer parentheses and using
square brackets to make the inner structure easier to see:
$$\bigl[(H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)\bigr] \eand (J \eor K)$$ Third, we
will sometimes want to translate the conjunction of three or more
sentences. For the sentence 'Alice, Bob, and Candice all went to the
party', suppose we let $A$ mean 'Alice went', $B$ mean 'Bob went', and
$C$ mean 'Candice went.' The definition only allows us to form a
conjunction out of two sentences, so we can translate it as
$(A \eand B) \eand C$ or as $A \eand (B \eand C)$. There is no reason to
distinguish between these, since the two translations are logically
equivalent. There is no logical difference between the first, in which
$(A \eand B)$ is conjoined with $C$, and the second, in which $A$ is
conjoined with $(B \eand C)$. So we might as well just write
$A \eand B \eand C$. As a matter of convention, we can leave out
parentheses when we conjoin three or more sentences.

Fourth, a similar situation arises with multiple disjunctions. 'Either
Alice, Bob, or Candice went to the party' can be translated as
$(A \eor B) \eor C$ or as $A \eor (B \eor C)$. Since these two
translations are logically equivalent, we may write $A \eor B \eor C$.

These latter two conventions only apply to multiple conjunctions or
multiple disjunctions. If a series of connectives includes both
disjunctions and conjunctions, then the parentheses are essential; as
with $(A \eand B) \eor C$ and $A \eand (B \eor C)$. The parentheses are
also required if there is a series of conditionals or biconditionals; as
with $(A \eif B) \eif C$ and $A \eiff (B \eiff C)$.

We have adopted these four rules as *notational conventions*, not as
changes to the definition of a sentence. Strictly speaking,
$A \eor B \eor C$ is still not a sentence. Instead, it is a kind of
shorthand. We write it for the sake of convenience, but we really mean
the sentence $(A \eor (B \eor C))$.

Unless and until you are very confident about wffs and the use of
parentheses, it is probably good advice to stick to the formal rules.
These notational conventions are a way to skip steps when writing things
down; if you're unsure about whether it's OK to take the shortcut, the
safest thing is to go by the formal definition.

If we had given a different definition for a wff, then these could count
as wffs. We might have written rule 3 in this way: "If , , $\ldots$ are
wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}\eand\ldots\eand\script{Z})$, is a
wff." This would make it easier to translate some English sentences, but
would have the cost of making our formal language more complicated. We
would have to keep the complex definition in mind when we develop truth
tables and a proof system. We want a logical language that is
*expressively simple* and allows us to translate easily from English,
but we also want a *formally simple* language. (As we'll see later, this
is important if we want to be able to prove things *about* our
language.) Adopting notational conventions is a compromise between these
two desires.
